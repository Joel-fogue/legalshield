# legalshield
Selenium WebDriver + TestNG for UI automation of LegalShield POC

This codebase simply navigates to the "Why LegalShield", "Law Firms" and "Personal" Pages

We do so using Java and TestNG demonstrating the Page Object Model and other Java concepts such as Inheritance with the "extends Page" parent class

You'll need Eclipse and ChromeDriver to run these tests
